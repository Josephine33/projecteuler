 * execute: ./pe451
 *
 * I logged in to see that problem 451 had around 90 solutions, and decided to
 * attempt to be one of the first 100 solvers to enter the proper solution. As
 * such, I coded this a bit quickly. A "clean" solution would make use of the
 * Chinese Remainder Theorem, and the timing could probably be brought down
 * a tiny bit. But, all things considered, this runs very fast itself.
 *
 * Problem: Consider the number 15. There are eight positive integers less than
 * 15 which are coprime to 15: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14. The modular inverses
 * of these numbers modulo 15 are: 1, 8, 4, 13, 2, 11, 7, 14 because
 * 1*1 mod 15=1
 * 2*8=16 mod 15=1
 * 4*4=16 mod 15=1
 * 7*13=91 mod 15=1
 * 11*11=121 mod 15=1
 * 14*14=196 mod 15=1
 * Let I(n) be the largest positive number m smaller than n-1 such that the
 * modular inverse of m modulo n equals m itself. So I(15)=11. Also I(100)=51
 * and I(7)=1. Find the sum of I(n) for 3<=n<=2Â·10**7.
 *
 * The solution is documented in the code below. The code is in C with OpenMP.
 *
 * The result is found in 28 seconds on a 20-core Xeon and and 2:48 on a 2-core
 * core i7. Here is some of the output:
 * prime sieve created - 0.110000 seconds
 * list of 1270607 primes created - 0.050000 seconds
 * list of prime factors created for integers <= 20000000 - 5.350000 seconds
 * prime factor exponents computed for all integers - 0.980000 seconds

 * Notes on factoring:

 * We need to consider the prime factorization of positive integers less than

 * Since the product of the 8 smallest primes (2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19 = 9,699,690)
 * is less than 2*10^7 and the 9 smallest primes (9,699,690*23 = 223,092,870)

/*
 * Notes:
 *
 * Given a number n, we're looking for the largest m < n-1 such that m^2 is 1
 * modulo n. That's a mouthful. First, field theory tells us that we're only
 * interested in integers that are relatively prime with n (which is why the
 * problem asks for m < n-1 ... otherwise it would be a lot easier).
 *
 * Now, if n=p^k is a prime power and we have x^2 = 1 mod p^k, we consider:
 * a) 1 is a solution for x since 1*1=1 mod p^k = 1.
 * b) p^k-1 is a solution since (p^k-1)^2=p^(2k)-2p^k+1 (mod p^k) = 1. But,
 *    that's too big since we need m < n=p^k-1. :-(
 * c) Any other solutions? Well... that's sort of complicated. Ugh. Let's first
 *    consider the case when p=2. For n=p^1=2^1, we only have x=1 as a
 *    solution. When n=p^2=2^2, we only have x=1 and x=3. For n=p^k=2^k, we
 *    also find that 2^(k-1)+1 and 2^(k-1)-1 square to 1 modulo 2^k. For other
 *    primes, this doesn't happen and we only have 1 and p^k-1 as solutions.
 *
 * Thus, what we're going to do is as follows:
 * 1) Factor each integer within the given range (factoring a range of numbers
 *    is much faster than factoring each one individually). We'll store that
 *    factorization information using the struct defined above.
 * 2) Because of step 1, determining if a number is prime or a power of a prime
 *    is easy. In case of primes and prime powers, we consider if the prime is
 *    even or odd, returning the appropriate maximum square root of 1 directly.
 * 3) When the integer is composite having more than a single distinct prime
 *    factor, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem "in spirit" and iterate
 *    over potential candidates (instead of computing the C.R.T. result
 *    directly). We're only considering possible m that are both relatively
 *    prime with n AND such that m^2 is +1 or -1 modulo the prime power
 *    factors of n. When a candidate does not satisfy these properties, we
 *    simply move to the next candidate.
