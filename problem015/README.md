Problem
=======

Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down,
there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20x20 grid?

There are several ways to solve this problem, some direct and some recursive. I discuss a few
solutions on my code blog at http://code.jasonbhill.com/python/project-euler-problem-15/

This problem is a relatively common interview question, and so knowing the potential solutions is a
bit important if you're going for a software engineering position.
